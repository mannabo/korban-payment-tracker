# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Build and Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production (runs TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks
- **IMPORTANT**: Always run `npm run lint` after making code changes before committing

### Deployment Process ‚≠ê IMPORTANT ‚≠ê
- **Hosting Provider**: Hostinger (NOT Firebase!)
- **Domain**: korbanperdana.jpkkhangtuah.com
- **Repository**: GitHub (mannabo/korban-payment-tracker)
- **Auto-Deployment**: GitHub ‚Üí Hostinger integration
- **Deploy Command**: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push origin master`
- **Deployment Time**: 2-5 minutes after git push
- **DO NOT USE**: `firebase deploy` (Firebase config exists but not used for hosting)
- **Build Output**: `dist/` directory (for reference only, auto-deployed from GitHub)

### Firebase Configuration (Backend Only)
- Firebase Firestore for database
- Firebase Auth for authentication  
- Firebase Storage for file uploads
- `firebase.json` configured but hosting NOT used (use Hostinger instead)

## Architecture Overview

### Application Structure
This is a **React + TypeScript + Firebase** web application for managing korban (Islamic sacrifice) payment tracking with dual interfaces:

1. **Public Portal** - Participant payment tracking and lookup
2. **Admin Panel** - Complete management dashboard for groups, participants, and payments

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Auth** integration with role-based access control
- **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) manages auth state
- **User Roles**: `admin` | `participant` with different UI flows
- **AutoLogin** flow in main App.tsx routes users based on authentication status

### Data Layer (Firebase Firestore)
**Core Collections:**
- `groups` - Group management with participant organization
- `participants` - Individual participant records with sacrifice type selection
- `payments` - Monthly payment tracking (RM100/month ÔøΩ 8 months = RM800 total)
- `participantCredits` - Advanced credit system for prepaid balances and transaction history
- `userRoles` - User authentication to participant/admin mapping
- `participantChangeRequests` - Approval workflow for participant data changes
- `auditLogs` - Change tracking and audit trail

**Key Data Patterns:**
- Real-time subscriptions using `onSnapshot` for live updates
- Payment tracking by month (format: "2025-08" to "2026-03")
- Sacrifice type pricing: All types default to RM100/month (korban_sunat, korban_nazar, aqiqah)

### Core Business Logic

**Payment Calculation:**
- **Monthly Amount**: RM100 per participant per month
- **Total Expected**: RM800 per participant (8 months: Aug 2025 - Mar 2026)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time calculation of paid vs. unpaid amounts
- **IMPORTANT**: Use `KORBAN_MONTHLY_AMOUNT` (RM100) for monthly operations, `KORBAN_PRICE_PER_PARTICIPANT` (RM800) for totals

**Change Request Workflow:**
- Participants can request changes to their details via public portal
- Admin approval required for name, phone, email, and sacrifice type changes
- Audit logging for all changes with full traceability

### Component Architecture

**Page Components** (`src/pages/`):
- `PaymentTracking.tsx` - Main admin payment management interface
- `Dashboard.tsx` - Admin overview with statistics
- `GroupManagement.tsx` - CRUD operations for groups and participants
- `ParticipantDashboard.tsx` - Authenticated participant view
- `StyledPublicPortal.tsx` - Public interface for participant lookup

**Key Shared Components** (`src/components/`):
- `PublicParticipantDashboard.tsx` - Participant progress view with credit system integration
- `ReceiptManagement.tsx` - Advanced receipt approval with credit auto-conversion
- `GroupProgressView.tsx` - Group-level payment visualization
- `ChangeRequestManagement.tsx` - Admin interface for approving participant changes
- `ParticipantLookup.tsx` - Name-based participant search

**Credit System Services** (`src/utils/`):
- `creditService.ts` - Complete credit lifecycle management with auto-conversion logic
- `firestore.ts` - Database operations including credit transactions

### State Management Patterns
- **React Context** for authentication state
- **Real-time Firebase subscriptions** for data synchronization
- **Local component state** for UI interactions
- **useResponsive hook** for mobile-first responsive design

### Export & Reporting
- **Excel export functionality** (`src/utils/exportUtils.ts`)
- Multiple report types: current view, group summaries, monthly summaries, detailed reports
- Uses `xlsx` library for spreadsheet generation

### Code Conventions
- **TypeScript interfaces** in `src/types/index.ts` define all data structures
- **Firestore utilities** in `src/utils/firestore.ts` for all database operations
- **Consistent naming**: Use Malaysian/Malay terms in UI (e.g., "Peserta", "Kumpulan")
- **Payment calculations**: Always use monthly constants, not hardcoded values
- **Import organization**: Follow existing patterns - React/external imports first, then local imports
- **Component structure**: Functional components with TypeScript, hooks pattern throughout
- **Error handling**: Always include try-catch blocks for Firebase operations

### Firebase Security
- Firestore security rules configured (`firestore.rules`)
- Role-based access control with separate read/write permissions for admin vs participant data
- Public read access for participant lookup functionality

### Development Notes
- **Mobile-first responsive design** using Tailwind CSS v4
- **Real-time updates** throughout the application via Firebase subscriptions
- **Defensive error handling** with fallbacks for permission-denied scenarios
- **Audit trail** for all data modifications with user attribution

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Manual testing** required for all payment-related features
- **Cross-browser testing** on mobile devices essential for public portal
- **Data validation** must be thorough for payment amounts and participant information
- **Firebase security rules** should be tested with different user roles

### Payment Formula Migration Notes
Recent change: Monthly payment amount changed from RM800 to RM100 per month. When working on payment-related features:
- Individual monthly payments: RM100
- Total participant cost: RM800 (RM100 ÔøΩ 8 months)
- Update both admin payment creation and participant progress calculations
- Verify export utilities use correct monthly amounts
