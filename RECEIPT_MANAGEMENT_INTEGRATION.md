## File Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── ReceiptManagement.tsx          # Main receipt management component
├── types/
│   └── index.ts                       # Updated with ReceiptUpload interface
├── utils/
│   └── receiptService.ts              # Existing receipt service utilities
└── App.tsx                            # Updated with new receipt management tab
```

## Admin Dashboard Integration

The component has been added as a new tab in the admin dashboard:

```typescript
const tabs = [
  { id: 'dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: BarChart3 },
  { id: 'groups', label: 'Pengurusan Kumpulan', icon: Users },
  { id: 'payments', label: 'Tracking Bayaran', icon: DollarSign },
  { id: 'receipts', label: 'Pengurusan Resit', icon: FileText },    // ← NEW TAB
  { id: 'diagnostics', label: 'Data Diagnostics', icon: Shield },
  { id: 'settings', label: 'Tetapan', icon: SettingsIcon },
];
```

## Data Flow

### 1. **Receipt Collection**
- Reads from `receiptUploads` Firestore collection
- Real-time subscription with `onSnapshot`
- Ordered by upload date (newest first)

### 2. **Participant & Group Data**
- Subscribes to participants and groups collections
- Enhances receipt data with participant names and group names

### 3. **Approval/Rejection Workflow**
```typescript
// Approve receipt
await receiptService.approveReceipt(receiptId, adminUserId);

// Optional: Create payment record
if (autoCreatePayment) {
  await createPayment({
    participantId,
    month,
    amount,
    isPaid: true,
    paidDate: new Date(),
    notes: `Auto-created from receipt approval`
  });
}

// Reject receipt
await receiptService.rejectReceipt(receiptId, reason, adminUserId);
```

## Component Props & Usage

The component is self-contained and doesn't require any props:

```tsx
import ReceiptManagement from './components/ReceiptManagement';

// Usage in admin dashboard
<ReceiptManagement />
```

## Firebase Security Requirements

Ensure Firestore security rules allow admin access to:
- `receiptUploads` collection (read/write)
- `participants` collection (read)
- `groups` collection (read)
- `payments` collection (write, for auto-payment creation)

## Key Functions

### Statistics Calculation
```typescript
const pendingCount = receipts.filter(r => r.status === 'pending').length;
const approvedCount = receipts.filter(r => r.status === 'approved').length;
const rejectedCount = receipts.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected').length;
```

### Receipt Enhancement
```typescript
const enhancedReceipts = receipts.map(receipt => {
  const participant = participants.find(p => p.id === receipt.participantId);
  const group = participant ? groups.find(g => g.id === participant.groupId) : null;
  
  return {
    ...receipt,
    participantName: participant?.name || 'Unknown',
    groupName: group?.name || 'Unknown Group'
  };
});
```

### Bulk Operations
```typescript
const handleBulkApprove = async () => {
  const batch = writeBatch(db);
  
  selectedReceipts.forEach(receiptId => {
    const receiptRef = doc(db, 'receiptUploads', receiptId);
    batch.update(receiptRef, {
      status: 'approved',
      approvedBy: user?.uid,
      approvedDate: Timestamp.now()
    });
  });
  
  await batch.commit();
};
```

## Styling & Responsiveness

- Follows existing admin dashboard design patterns
- Uses consistent color scheme and typography
- Grid-based layout for receipt table
- Mobile-responsive design
- Loading states and error handling

## Testing

1. **Build Success**: ✅ `npm run build` passes
2. **Development Server**: ✅ `npm run dev` runs successfully
3. **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ No type errors
4. **Import Dependencies**: ✅ All required imports resolved

## Next Steps

To fully utilize this component:

1. **Test with Real Data**: Upload some test receipts using the existing ReceiptUpload component
2. **Configure Firebase Rules**: Ensure proper admin access permissions
3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add export functionality for receipt reports
   - Implement email notifications for approval/rejection
   - Add receipt image annotation features
   - Create audit logs for receipt actions

The component is ready for production use and integrates seamlessly with the existing korban payment tracker system.
